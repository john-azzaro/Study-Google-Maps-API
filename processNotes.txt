For this google maps study, the primary goal is to embed a map on our page as well as some additional features 
available to you as a developer, like directions, markers, search nearby locations, info windows, etc.



STEP 1: Go to the Google Developers website for developer keys
================================================================
Go to the google cloud platform console and from the navigation menu click on "Credentials" and click on
