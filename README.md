## What is Google Maps API Study?
"Google Maps API Study" is an exploration of Google maps and associated functionalities, such as markers, etc.  Please note that the current reduced functionality of Google maps in this study is due to a recent change in how google handles the google maps api, in particular the limited use without linked credit card, etc.).  Although the current study is short and concise, more features will be added in the future.

Here are a few questions examined in this study:

## What are the key takeaways from the Social Widgets Study?

### There are a LOT of ways to customize the Google Maps API.
-----------
<dd>

This study goes over a few of the special customization, like creating a location marker, etc.  But there are a ton of other things you can do, such as custimizing the search filters, rank locations by distance, popularity, etc. Filters are particularly interesting, as you can use type filters in addition to yor location search for things like: gas_station, hospital, spa, car_rental, museum, etc.

### The Google Maps API isnt free anymore...
-----------
<dd>

As of June 11, 2018 the Google Maps API is no longer free, at least as far as basic development goes.  Valid API keys are needed which require credit card information, so that means the API is no longer keyless.  And although you still get the first $200 of monthly usage free, implementing Dynamic Maps is limited to under 28,000 page loads *per month*. That might seem like a lot, but before the change, Dynamic Maps allowed 25,000 loads *per day*.  Speaking of pricing, some developers reported price increases of up to 1400% due to the change in pricing strucure for commerical use of the API. Are there alternatives? Yes, but Google Maps seems to have a monopoly on the market more than a year after this change went into effect.
