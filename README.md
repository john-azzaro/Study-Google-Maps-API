## What is Google Maps API Study?
"Google Maps API Study" is an exploration of Google maps and associated functionalities, suck as markers, etc. However, it should be noted that although google maps is one of the best map apps on the market, there has been a change to the way google maps handles the API making it a little less developer friendly (e.g. API key per project and linked credit card). Since this is a short and concise study only basic funcitonality if covered but more features will be added in the future.
